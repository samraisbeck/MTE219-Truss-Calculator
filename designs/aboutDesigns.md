# The Designs Folder

This folder is meant to hold saved designs in text format. Designs can then be loaded into the console by directly
starting `loadAndSave.py [filename to be loaded]`. The designs follow a strict format so it's best to just use the software
to save them.

##### That's all!
Really, this file is just a placeholder so that the designs folder can be committed, but all existing designs NOT be committed.
