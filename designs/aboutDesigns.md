# The Designs Folder

This folder is meant to hold saved designs in text format. Designs can then be loaded by running the program and going to `File -> Load` or hit `Ctrl+L`. Alternatively,
files can be loaded directly by running `python main.py designName`, and do not include the `.txt` extension. The designs follow a strict format so it's best to just use the software to save them.

##### That's all!
Really, this file is just a placeholder so that the designs folder can be committed, but all existing designs NOT be committed.
